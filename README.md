If you want to download and run this project in Unity Editor, you will need the paid asset [Odin Inspector](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/utilities/odin-inspector-and-serializer-89041).

It is best to copy Odin Inspector's `Sirenx` folder from another project before opening this project for the first time on your computer.

If you open the project without Odin Inspector installed, all serialized data that was written by Odin Inspector's Serializer will be lost due to the reimport of all assets and you will have to pull from the repo again.

Project version is Unity Engine 2019.1.5f1
